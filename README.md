**Managing Tables:**  

- CreateTable - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned throughput settings. 
- DescribeTable - Returns metadata for a table, such as table size, status, and index information. 
- UpdateTable - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a table. 
  Optionally, you can modify the provisioned throughput settings for global secondary indexes on the table. 
- ListTables - Returns a list of all tables associated with the current AWS account and endpoint. 
- DeleteTable - Deletes a table and all of its indexes. 

**Reading Data:** 
- GetItem - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a given primary key. 
- BatchGetItem - Performs multiple GetItem requests for data items using their primary keys, from one table or 
multiple tables. 
- Query - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary index. 
- Scan - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually consistent. 

**Modifying Data:** 
- PutItem - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item with a new item (including all the attributes). 
- UpdateItem - Modifies the attributes of an existing item. 
- DeleteItem - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. 
- BatchWriteItem - Performs multiple PutItem and DeleteItem requests across multiple tables in a single request.
